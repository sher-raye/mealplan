/*(a)   Design a Meal class with two fields-one that holds the name of the entrée, the other that holds a calorie count integer.
 Include a constructor that sets a Meal's fields with parameters,
or uses default values when no parameters are provided.
(b)  Include an overloaded insertion operator function that displays a Meal's values.
(c)   Include an overloaded extraction operator that prompts a user for an entrée name and calorie
count for a meal.
(d)  Include an overloaded operator+()function that allows you to add two or more Meal
objects. Adding two Meal objects means adding their calorie values and creating a summary
Meal object in which you store "Daily Total" in the entrée field.
(e)   Write a main()function that declares four Meal objects named breakfast, lunch,
dinner, and total. Provide values for the breakfast, lunch, and dinner objects.
Include the statement total = breakfast + lunch + dinner; in your program,
then display values for the four Meal objects. Save the file as Meal.cpp */
